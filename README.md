Heyo, I’m Red. 

Ive been doing coding for 2 years and still learning the ropes about how this all works. 
I have a functional understanding of SQL, Python, Java, and C++ and my next project is C#.
I’m interested in lots of things, but mainly Development and Coding of my random projects as well as finding a job in the field.
I am currently going through college and will graduate in April 2022 with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. 
I’m looking to collaborate on anything at this point. I need exp and I have the mind to create new things.

I am not big on social mnedia for obvious reasons... but I do keep one thing active so you can reach me on discord > redangel121, I keep my DMs open so just let me know how you found me and the reason for contact.

Thanks for taking the time to learn about me today, Stay Awesome out there!
