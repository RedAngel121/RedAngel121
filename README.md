Heyo, I’m Red. 

Ive been coding as a hobby since 2005 and still learning new things as they come along. 
I have a semi-functional understanding of almost any lang including SQL, Python, Java, C++, C# etc.
I’m interested in lots of things, but mainly Development and Coding of my random projects as well as finding a better job in the field of Server Administration.
Graduated college in April of 2022 with a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology.
I’m looking to collaborate on anything at this point. I need exp and I have a mind to create new things.

I am not big on social mnedia for obvious reasons... but I do keep one thing active so you can reach me on discord > redangel121, I keep my DMs open so just let me know how you found me and the reason for contact.

Thanks for taking the time to learn about me today, Stay Awesome out there!
